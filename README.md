# Password_Generator
A password generator is a tool that automatically creates strong, random passwords to enhance digital security. It typically uses a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters to produce passwords that are hard to guess or crack. This helps protect user accounts and sensitive data from unauthorized access.
